# âš¡ Real-Time Trading Simulator (C++ | OKX)

This project is a real-time trading simulator developed in C++ as part of the GoQuant recruitment challenge. It connects to a WebSocket orderbook feed from OKX, processes live L2 market data, and computes key trading metrics including slippage, fees, market impact, and latency.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time WebSocket connection to OKX (mocked endpoint for development)
- Models for:
  - **Slippage estimation** (linear model)
  - **Fee estimation** (tier-based model)
  - **Market impact** (Almgren-Chriss inspired)
  - **Maker/Taker proportion** (logistic regression)
- Internal latency calculation per tick
- Modular architecture for maintainability and testing
- CLI-based (headless) â€” no GUI required

## ðŸ“¡ WebSocket Endpoint

> **NOTE:** Accessing OKX WebSocket data may require VPN due to regional restrictions.

- WebSocket URL: `wss://ws.gomarket-cpp.goquant.io/ws/l2-orderbook/okx/BTC-USDT-SWAP`
- Sample Response:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-04T10:39:13Z",
  "exchange": "OKX",
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT-SWAP",
  "asks": [["95445.5", "9.06"]],
  "bids": [["95445.4", "1104.23"]]
}
